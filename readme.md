# Discoveries by Michal Biesiada

The main goal of this project is keep a data about SOHO comets discovered by me. ‚≠ê I'm focusing here on Sungrazer Project, citizen science project founded by NASA. I'm not talking here about other discoveries or co-discoveries connected with Zooniverse or TOTAS (ESA) for instance. Just SOHO comets. I suppose it would be little helpful for me, I mean organize the data. ‚≠ê
